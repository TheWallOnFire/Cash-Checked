# Functional requirements: List the features developers can build to enable users to complete tasks according to your business requirements. To do this, use existing mind maps or user stories. After defining what your app will do, assign a unique name and number to every functional requirement along with a short description, rationale, and status.

# Subsystem requirements: Describe requirements for developing an app from the perspective of software and hardware subsystems. For example, if you’re going to build a fitness activity tracking app, you’ll need to write requirements for wearable trackers that will synchronize with the app.

# Business rules: Since every business is subject to laws, policies, and industry standards, these will be obvious sources of requirements for an SRS. Here’s a shortlist of requirement sources:
+ Corporate policy
+ Government regulations
+ Industry standards
+ User roles and permission ratings
+ If-then models of user behavior
+ Computational algorithms, if any

# Data requirements: When developing a mobile app, you need to create, store, modify, display, delete, process, and use massive amounts of data. To manage data flows, you need to:
+ outline a logical model of data entity interactions
+ define entities in the data dictionary
+ specify how the system must enforce data analysis, retention, or disposal
+ choose types of data reports (spreadsheets, charts, dashboards, etc.)

# Quality attributes: Writing clear quality criteria ensures that developers will meet your expectations with the end product. You need to consider quality attributes that are important to:
+ your business and users, such as usability, performance, and security (external attributes)
+ developers, such as efficiency, modifiability, and portability (internal attributes)

# External interfaces: This part of a functional requirements document for a mobile application is needed to ensure that your app will communicate properly with users and external hardware or software systems. In an SRS, you need to write down requirements for:
+ User interfaces. Specify the design of your mobile app’s screens (standards for fonts, icons, color schemes, images, screen size, layout, resolution, and so forth)
+ Software interfaces. Describe interactions between your app and other software components including other apps, websites, libraries, databases, and tools.
+ Hardware interfaces. Outline each of the supported device types, data and control interactions between software and hardware, and communication protocols to be used.
+ Communications interfaces. In an SRS for your mobile app, state requirements for any communications functions your app will use, including in-app messages, push notifications, emails, and network protocols.

# Constraints: Record constraints that restrict your mobile app’s design, operation, and implementation. First of all, check whether your mobile app specification aligns with Apple App Store and Google Play Store requirements. Additionally, specify other system constraints imposed, for instance, by the programming language used or rules of using third-party APIs or content.

# Localization requirements: If you want your app to be used in countries, cultures, and geographic locations that differ from those in which it was created, then you should set requirements for changing:
+ Currency
+ Date, number, address, and telephone number formats
+ Language (including national spelling conventions, local dialects, directions)
+ Functionality to comply with regulations and laws
+ Content in consideration of cultural and political issues
+ Time zones
+ Weights and measures
+ Other variables
